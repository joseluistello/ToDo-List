## 1. Domain

### 1.1 Description

**Definition:**

> Domain - A sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity. The subject area to which the user applies a program is the domain of the software. [Domain-Driven Design Reference](http://domainlanguage.com/ddd/reference/), Eric Evans

**Main reasons for selecting this domain:**

- It is common to have different tasks throughout the day.
- It is not easy to remember everything we have to do.
- It's a simple project with which I can learn a little more about Django.
- This project can help people to manage their day to day life.
